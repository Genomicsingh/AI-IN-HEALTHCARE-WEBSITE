        <h2>1. Enhanced Precision in Surgical Procedures
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>AI-driven robotic systems assist surgeons by improving precision, stability, and control during surgeries, minimizing human error and reducing recovery time. <br>
        The da Vinci Surgical System uses AI-guided robotics for highly precise minimally invasive surgeries.
        <br>
        Surgeons without AI assistance face limitations in precision, particularly in complex procedures, while AI enhances accuracy and reduces risks.</p>
        
        <h2>2. AI-Assisted Preoperative Planning</h2> <br>
        <p>AI models analyze patient data (imaging, medical history) to help surgeons plan surgeries more effectively, identifying the best surgical approach for each individual.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Traditional preoperative planning relies on human intuition, which can miss subtle factors that AI can identify through comprehensive data analysis.</p>
