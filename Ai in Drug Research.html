        <h2>1. Accelerated Drug Discovery through AI
            
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>AI dramatically speeds up the drug discovery process by analyzing vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates, reducing the time taken to develop new medicines.
        <br>
        Atomwiseâ€™s AI identified potential treatments for Ebola in less than a day, compared to traditional methods that take months or years.        <br></p>
        
        <h2>2. AI in Repurposing Existing Drugs</h2> <br>
        <p>AI identifies new therapeutic uses for existing drugs by analyzing vast medical data, accelerating treatment options for diseases that lack effective therapies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>AI repurposed Remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 by analyzing its potential effects on viral infections.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Future of AI in Fully Autonomous Drug Discovery</h2>
        <br>
        <p>By 2035, AI may autonomously discover and develop drugs, conducting research, testing, and optimization with minimal human intervention, revolutionizing pharmaceutical research.
            <br>
            AI could reduce drug development costs by up to 70% and cut discovery timelines in half, making treatments more affordable and accessible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Fully autonomous AI systems may take over the entire drug development pipeline, from molecule discovery to clinical testing, transforming healthcare.
