        <h2>1. Accuracy and speed of  AI in diagnosing Diseases
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>AI analyzes large datasets like medical images or lab results faster and more accurately than humans, detecting patterns that may be missed by experts, improving early diagnosis.
        <br>
        A Lancet study showed AI outperforms radiologists in detecting diseases 94.6% of the time.
        <br>
        Google Healthâ€™s AI reduces false negatives in breast cancer detection by 11.5%. Example: FDA-approved IDx-DR diagnoses diabetic retinopathy with 91% accuracy.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Reduction of Diagnostic Error</h2> <br>
        <p>AI reduces human diagnostic errors by learning from vast datasets, improving precision and lowering misdiagnosis rates, saving lives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nature Medicine showed AI achieved 94.5% accuracy diagnosing lung cancer, compared to 88% for human radiologists.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Cost Efficiency and Accessibility</h2>
        <br>
        <p>AI-powered tools reduce diagnostic costs and improve accessibility, providing affordable diagnostics in regions lacking specialists.
            <br>
            Ada Health offers AI-based diagnostics in remote areas
